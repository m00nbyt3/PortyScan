# PortyScan
Simple and slow, but functional and easy-to-use port scanner. Based on Heath Adams PEH course port scanner.

The tool search for open ports in a defined network, by its IPv4 address. It uses sockets to do so.
It searches in the range of 1 to 65535 port addresses. It also saves detected opened ports in a file called "scanns.log".

For using this tool, the only requirement is to have Python 3.x installed.

For launching the tool, just execute: python3 PortyScan.py \<ip\>

  Enjoy it!
